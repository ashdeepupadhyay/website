            Hi! I am Ashdeep Upadhyay. I work at Ticketmaster on research
            projects, writing python scripts to help designers and making a tool
            for creating maps. I am a passionate developer and I take pride in
            the multiple delivered projects I have worked on and the teams I
            have worked with. I studied Engineering(Information Technology) from
            the Army Institute Of Technology. I did just competitive programming
            for initial years in college and then started with web
            development(build a various website for college fest , admissions
            etc) and later did my final year project building a pipeline for a
            company Calsoft. After passing out of college joined the company
            Livelike where I learned a lot and we started with around eight
            people and grew to 35 in India only(Livelike have an office in US
            and France too). From doing French Open , FIFA 2018 and various
            other projects it was a dream come too (Sports is one of the domains
            which I always love) and roller coaster journey while making some
            bonds hopefully for life. I like to write blogs , travel , make
            food, learn a different programming language , technologies and make
            a small prototype using them. I consider myself a 'forever student',
            eager to learn new tech stacks everyday.
